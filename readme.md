# Chef For A Night - Backend
________________________________________________________________
Chef For A Night is a simple application for a "Master Chef" game.
It will provide you with a variety of cooking tasks and ideas.

This repository contains the application backend - the endpoint to be used for creating new tasks or recipes, 
or getting ideas for existing ones.

It is currently written using FastAPI, and in the future might move to NodeJS if I feel like learning it :)
